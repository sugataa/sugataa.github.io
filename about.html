      <h2 class="h2-sub">Programming</h2>

      <p>I've been fascinated with computers since I was kid and started "programming" websites for fun in middle school, eventually leading to java applets in high school.</p>

      <p>I started out as a Life Science major in college, but ended up switching to Computer Science early on after I began to develop a serious interest in programming. I believe it's one the most fortuitous events of my life.</p>

      <p>I've <a href="">participated</a> in a number of hackathons across North America.</p>

      <p>I also enjoy writing about programming related topics (amongst other things). <a href="https://medium.com/@sugata">Check it out.</a></p>
