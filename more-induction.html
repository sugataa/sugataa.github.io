  <div class="article">
    <p>So, I am going to continue with the theme of induction . Previously, I posted about simple induction, now I'm going to introduce you to complete induction. </p>
<p>I view complete induction as an extension of simple induction in that it draws upon the same ideas but is more powerful. It removes the limitations that are inherent in simple induction. For example, suppose you want to prove some property about binary trees and try to do induction on the height of the tree. You'd like to use the induction hypothesis to prove the property in question for the sub-trees. However, the height of each sub-tree is not necessarily one less than the height of the current tree (the height could be even less). Thus, you wouldn't be able to apply the induction hypothesis to each sub-tree, instead we would use complete induction.</p>
<p>To solve most problems in simple induction I use, "if p(k) is true then p(k+1) is true" while in complete induction it is preferable to use "if p(i) is true for all i less than or equal to k then p(k+1) is true", where p(k) is some statement. The nice thing about complete induction is that you get to assume that the property is true of all the natural numbers less than k, instead of just k - 1 as is the case in simple induction.</p>
<p>Note that simple and complete induction are not identical but may be equivalent. It is easy to see that if simple induction is true then strong induction is true: if you know that statement p(i) is true for all i less than or equal to k, then you know that it is true, in particular, for i= k and can use simple induction. It is harder to prove, but still true, that if strong induction is true, then simple induction is true. That is what I mean by "equivalent".</p>
<p>Let's do an example of complete induction:</p>
<p>Question: Prove that postage of exactly n cents can be made using only 3 and 4 cent stamps for every natural number n greater than 5.</p>

<img alt="" src="/img/more-ind/conc2.png" /></p>
<p>There we have an example of complete induction in action.</p>
